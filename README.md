# CNN-Fashion-MNIST-Classifying
## Introduction to the datase
 FashionMNIST is a popular dataset in the field of machine 
learning and computer vision. It is often used as a 
benchmark dataset for tasks related to image 
classification and pattern recognition.\
 \
 • Dataset Size: FashionMNIST contains 60,000 training 
images and 10,000 testing images. These images are 
grayscale and have a resolution of 28x28 pixels.\
 \
 • Classes: The dataset consists of 10 different classes of 
clothing items, each represented by a unique label. These 
classes include items like t-shirts, trousers, dresses, 
sneakers, sandals, and more\

 
**In this notebook, we will be doing classification of images using Convolutional Neural Networks.**
